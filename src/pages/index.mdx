    I'm currently an undergraduate at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/) studying computers. I've worked at
    [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/), [Zellic](https://zellic.io), [OtterSec](https://osec.io),
    [Carnegie Mellon University's REUSE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/) and instructed
    [595G Seminar in Computer Security](https://cs595.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/) at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
    One day, I hope to be a professor.

      Some fun things I've made include:
      <Project name="xinOS" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/xinOS-old" desc="hyperfast operating system for retro games" />
      <Project name="aski" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/aski" desc="high abstraction assembler with types" aside="Replit Language Jam finalist" />
      <Project name="OSpaint" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/OSpaint" desc="MSpaint as an operating system" aside="CodeDayLA best in class winner" />
      <Project name="warpalloc" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/warpalloc" desc="portable memory allocator in assembly" />
      <Project name="ramenbox" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/ramenbox" desc="6502 emulator + game console" aside="CodeDay best hardware winner" />
    </div>

    I also play CTFs with [DiceGang](https://dicega.ng), organize CTF events
    with the [1D6 Foundation](https://1d6.foundation/), and compete in the
    [International Cybersecurity Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cybersecurity_Challenge)
    with the U.S Cybersecurity Team. As a researcher, I've done guest lectures on exploitation at the
    [HOPE Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYr0Ut8n0bg), EPFL Innovation Park, Carnegie Mellon University, and UCSB's Seclab.

    I write about interesting technical problems on [my blog](/blog).
