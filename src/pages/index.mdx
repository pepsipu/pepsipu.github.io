    I'm currently the course instructor of [595G, Seminar in Computer Security](https://cs595.seclab.cs.ucsb.edu/)
    at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Previously, I was a founding
    member and blockchain security auditor at
    [OtterSec](https://osec.io) and a quantitative researcher at [Zellic](https://zellic.io).

    I'd like to explore as much computer science and pure mathematics as I
    can. I enjoy making embedded systems, where programmers have creative freedom over
    hardware, software, and the bridge between the two.

      Some of my favorite personal projects include:
      <Project name="xinOS" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/xinOS-old" desc="hyperfast operating system for retro games" />
      <Project name="aski" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/aski" desc="high abstraction assembler with types" aside="Replit Language Jam finalist" />
      <Project name="OSpaint" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/OSpaint" desc="MSpaint as an operating system" aside="CodeDayLA best in class winner" />
      <Project name="warpalloc" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/warpalloc" desc="portable memory allocator in assembly" />
      <Project name="ramenbox" href="https://github.com/pepsipu/ramenbox" desc="6502 emulator + game console" aside="CodeDay best hardware winner" />

    I play Capture-the-Flag competitions with the [United States' #1 competitive cybersecurity team](https://ctftime.org/stats/2022/US),
    [DiceGang](https://dicega.ng), and practice for the [International Cybersecurity Competition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Cybersecurity_Challenge)
    with the U.S. Cybersecurity Team. Sometimes, I work with government organizations
    like the United States AFA, AÃ©roports de Paris, Saudi FCSP and UAE Cybersecurity
    Council as well as blockchains like [Solana](https://solana.com), [Sui](https://sui.io/), and [Aptos](https://aptoslabs.com) to make the internet safer.

    As a researcher, I've done guest lectures on exploitation at the
    [HOPE Conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYr0Ut8n0bg), Carnegie Mellon University, and EPFL Innovation Park. This summer, I'll
    be working with the picoCTF team at [Carnegie Mellon University's REU](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/). One day, I hope to be a professor.

    I write about interesting technical problems and ideas on [my blog](/blog).
